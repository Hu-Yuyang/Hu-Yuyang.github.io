I am a first-year Master student in the <a href="https://cigroup.wustl.edu/">Computational Imaging Group</a> with the Department of ESE at Washington University in St. Louis. 

Currently, my research of interests include imaging with deep learning, MRI, Parallel image, and large-scale optimization.
